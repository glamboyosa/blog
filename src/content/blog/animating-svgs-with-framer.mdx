ICYMI, I launched <Link href="https://to.glamboyosa.xyz">TO</Link>, a tool to upscale low quality images with AI. In the app, I wanted a fun experience and this included the loading UI. Why? I firmly believe a fun loading experience is key, especially when there might be a long wait time.

<Divider />

Here's what it looks like:

<Image src="/to-loading.gif" alt="the TO website loading animation" />

The cool thing though, it was just a static SVG from <Link href="https://popsy.co">Popsy.co</Link>. So the big question is, how do we move from a static SVG to an animated one ? We need to learn about an SVG element – Paths

<Divider />

<Heading>SVG Paths</Heading>

Paths make intricate shapes by joining several straight or curved lines. It can be used to create lines, curves, arcs, and more!

A `path` element's shape is defined by its parameter called `d`. The `d` attribute contains a series of commands and their parameters.

<Heading>Understanding the loading animation</Heading>

Now that we have a basic grasp of paths, I can now explain how the SVG is animated. Basically, we animate the SVG's `path` property via some attributes. This results in the SVG being "drawn". This is where <Link href="https://www.framer.com/motion/">Framer Motion</Link> comes into play. It is a library that makes writing declarative animations a breeze. With Framer, we are easily able to animate the path with very few LOC.

<Heading>Convert SVG & Path to Motion Element</Heading>

The first step is to convert the SVG and specifically it's path property to a Motion element so we can apply Framer Motion specific props.

From this:

<br />
```tsx
<svg
  width="500"
  height="500"
  viewBox="0 0 960 960"
  fill="none"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
>
  <path
    d="M578.092 588.415C567.519 579.937 553.128 577.096 539.714 578.961C527.945 580.595 516.9 585.553 505.314 588.229C493.728 590.905 480.559 590.929 471.114 583.699"
    stroke={`${theme === "light" ? "#171717" : "#fff"}`}
    stroke-width="3.291"
    stroke-linecap="round"
    stroke-linejoin="round"
    strokeWidth={3}
  />
</svg>
```

<br />
To this:
<br />
```tsx
<motion.svg
  width="500"
  height="500"
  viewBox="0 0 960 960"
  fill="none"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
>
  <motion.path
    d="M578.092 588.415C567.519 579.937 553.128 577.096 539.714 578.961C527.945 580.595 516.9 585.553 505.314 588.229C493.728 590.905 480.559 590.929 471.114 583.699"
    stroke={`${theme === "light" ? "#171717" : "#fff"}`}
    stroke-width="3.291"
    stroke-linecap="round"
    stroke-linejoin="round"
    strokeWidth={3}
  />
</motion.svg>
```
<br />

> **NOTE** For the purpose of this article we only use the SVG and it's `path` property.

<Heading> Adding Motion Properties </Heading>

Framer Motion provides a `pathLength` property that goes from 0-1.
So it basically draws it from invisible to visible along it's curves. Here's what the final output looks like:

```tsx
<motion.svg
  width="500"
  height="500"
  viewBox="0 0 960 960"
  fill="none"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
>
  <motion.path
    d="M578.092 588.415C567.519 579.937 553.128 577.096 539.714 578.961C527.945 580.595 516.9 585.553 505.314 588.229C493.728 590.905 480.559 590.929 471.114 583.699"
    stroke={`${theme === "light" ? "#171717" : "#fff"}`}
    stroke-width="3.291"
    stroke-linecap="round"
    stroke-linejoin="round"
    initial={{ pathLength: 0 }}
    animate={{ pathLength: 1 }}
    transition={{
      duration: 0.75,
      ease: "easeInOut",
      repeat: Infinity,
      repeatType: "loop",
      repeatDelay: 0.2,
    }}
    strokeWidth={3}
  />
</motion.svg>
```

<br />

Here, we have `initial` and `animate` props and we basically say when the SVG enters the DOM have the path not be drawn (almost not exist) and then draw it.

We also use the `transition` prop which is similar to the CSS transition prop. The most important thing here about this is `repeat:Infinity` which ensures the animation goes from 0-1 indefintely (until the image is finished processing within the context of the app).

<Heading>Conclusion</Heading>

We've learnt how to animate SVGs to draw paths but that's just one of the cool
things you can do with SVGs and Framer. I'd recommend this article by

<Link href="https://blog.noelcserepy.com/how-to-animate-svg-paths-with-framer-motion">Noël Cserépy</Link> if you want to learn more in-depth. I would also recommend <Link href="https://buildui.com">
  Build UI
</Link> by Sam Selikoff and Ryan Toronto, it helped me massively use Framer Motion.
